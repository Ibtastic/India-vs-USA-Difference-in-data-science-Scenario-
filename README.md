# India-vs-USA-Difference-in-data-science-Scenario-
The repository uses the data from Kaggle 2018 ML\DS survey. 

Ever since I've been interested in Data Science , I've thought of the differences in this field in India and USA. There have been certain norms regarding the differences that have been set during the years, what remains to be seen is whether the survey complies with those norms or contradicts them.

The kernel.ipynb file actually has python code to analyse and visualize this data. Since most of the plots that I made were using plotly,
they are not rendered in the file so I'll show them here with the insights I got from them. Although you can find some plots that I made with matplotlib in the code file itself.

## countrywise contribution in the survey. ##

As it appears, India has the second highest reponse after America.

## ML/DS Education preferences of Indians and Americans .##

* Going to universities is more popular in USA than India apparently due to the much higher number of Data Science courses offered in American universities. Only a few universities in India offer Data Science courses.
* Quite Strikingly, more Indians consider Kaggle Competitions as a way of learning than Americans.
* More Americans learn at work than Indians (probably due to greater number of data science jobs in America than India).
* The "Self-Taught" and "Online Course" pattern could be considered the same beacuse more respondents are Americans.
